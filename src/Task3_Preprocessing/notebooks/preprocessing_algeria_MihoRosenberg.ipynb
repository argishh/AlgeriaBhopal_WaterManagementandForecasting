This project aims to harness the power of machine learning to address the unique water resource challenges faced by both regions. By creating an open-source solution, we aim to empower Algeria and Bhopal to make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and build resilient water infrastructure for a sustainable future.\n","### **Project Goals**\n","**Develop a Comprehensive Open-Source Water Management and Forecasting System:** Create a user-friendly platform tailored to the specific needs of Algeria and Bhopal, integrating machine learning algorithms for precise water forecasting and efficient water resource management.\n","\n","- **Enhance Water Resource Utilization:** Improve the sustainable use of water resources in both regions by providing accurate forecasts and real-time monitoring.\n","- **Capacity Building:** Empower local stakeholders in Algeria and Bhopal with the knowledge and tools necessary to make well-informed decisions about water management.\n","- **Community Engagement:** Foster collaboration among local government agencies, NGOs, and the research community to collectively
